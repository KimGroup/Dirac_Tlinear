# Dirac_Tlinear

This Github repository contains the Monte Carlo results for the RKKY Ising model, as well as the Python script used for the Monte Carlo simulation.

1. RKKY_*.ipynb

These files are the Jupyter notebooks that import the Python class "Ising" from helper.py, run the MC simulations and save the resulting data to the folder "data", and then analyze and visualize the data and save the output figures in the folder "figures".
  - configs.ipynb plots the Ising configurations that were used in Fig. 1 of the paper
  - optcond.ipynb calculates and plots the optical conductivity vs frequency. These results are not shown in the manuscript but are useful for checking numerical stability.
  - resistivity.ipynb calculates and plots the resistivity, which is displayed in Fig. 2 of the paper.

2. helper.py

This file contains the Python scripts for the Monte Carlo simulation. This file is imported by the Jupyter notebooks.

3. data\*

The files in the data folder are h5 archives of Monte Carlo results. These data files are loaded and manipulated in the Jupyter notebooks.

4. figures\*

This folder contains pdf's of the visualized data generated by the Jupyter notebooks. These pdf's are later processed using Inkscape to generate the figures used in the manuscript.
